A simple Java desktop application that retrieves and displays weather information.  

This project was built as part of my **CE152 Java Programming** final assignment,
and showcases Java fundamentals, file handling, and basic data processing.

## Features
- Display weather data for multiple cities
- Search by city name with history tracking
- Load weather records from CSV (`Heathrow.csv`)
- Maintain search history in `city_history.txt`
- User-friendly console-based interface
